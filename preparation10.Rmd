## `{stringr}`

The `starwars` dataset is loaded with the `{tidyverse}` and contains information from the Star Wars API on many Star Wars characters.
For this Preparation, we will be focusing on the `hair_color`, `skin_color`, and `eye_color` variables.

```{r starwars_view}
starwars
```

### Hair Color Frequencies

Looking at the frequencies of hair color for the Star Wars characters, we can see that some characters have multiple colors:

```{r hair_freq}
starwars %>% 
  drop_na(hair_color) %>% 
  group_by(hair_color) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(n) %>% 
  print(n = length(hair_color))
```

Say that we wish to treat each color as a unique instance so if a character has two shades present in their hair, we would count each shade separately.
What we need to do is separate the `hair_color` column into individual columns, then restructure so that we have this information presented in a long format so that it will work within our data pipeline.

Notice that the most hair colors that a character has is two.

From the restructuring datasets materials earlier this semester, we would do the following (note that we are only *select*ing the column of interest to help focus the output):

```{r old_method}
restructure_method <- starwars %>% 
  select(hair_color) %>% 
  separate(hair_color, 
           into =  c("hair_first", "hair_second")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), 
               names_to = "hair_order", 
               values_to = "hair_color", 
               values_drop_na = TRUE) %>% 
  select(hair_color)

restructure_method

## Alternatively... so clean!
#
# starwars %>% 
#   select(hair_color) %>% 
#   separate_rows(hair_color)
```

In the code chunk below, you are provided with a character vector of the original `hair_color` column.

```{r hair_vector}
hair_vector <- starwars %>% 
  pull(hair_color)
```

Use `{stringr}` functions to *split* the multiple colors in the pipeline below (i.e., replace the two `___` with the appropriate code).

```{r str_hair}
str_hair <- hair_vector %>% 
  ___(pattern = ___) %>%  
  unlist() # converts the list to a vector

str_hair
```

The code chunk below is to compare your solution to the "old method".
You do not need to add any code; however, verify that you understand what the code is doing.

```{r output_comparison}
restructure_table <- restructure_method %>% 
  drop_na(hair_color) %>% 
  group_by(hair_color) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())

str_table <- tibble(hair_color = str_hair) %>% 
  drop_na(hair_color) %>% 
  group_by(hair_color) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())

waldo::compare(restructure_table, str_table)
```

Did you get `No differences`?

#### Challenge: Skin Color

Can you get the frequencies of the separate values for the variable `skin_color`?

```{r challenge}

```

## `{forcats}`

This will continue using the `starwars` dataset.

## Plot Frequencies of Eye Color

Plot a bar chart of the variable `eye_color`.
However, eye colors that have less than 2 observations should be *lump*ed into an "Other" color.
You do not need to separate the values of `eye_color`, but you must use `{forcats}` functions to create this plot.

```{r eye_color_plot}

```

Update your plot, using additional `{forcats}` functions, so that the bars are ordered by the heights (experiement with increasing and decreasing bar heights).

## `{lubridate}`

You will not be working with any particular dataset for these items.

### Calculate age

Update the `my_birthday` object below to contain your birthdate in the specified format, then calculate your age in the *number of days*.

```{r my_bday}
my_birthday <- "yyyy-mm-dd"

```

Calculate your instructor's birthday in *number of weeks*

```{r bradford_bday}
bradford_birthday <- "December 17, 1985"

```

### Vector of days

Create a vector called `first_days_2021` that contains the first day of every month in 2020.
That is, this vector should contain `"2021-01-01"` through `"2021-12-01"`.
Do this using `{lubridate}` arithmetic.
DO NOT hand type each date.

```{r first_days}

```

Using your `first_days_2021` and `{lubridate}` functions, identify which day of the week these first days were (e.g., Monday).
That is, `"2021-01-01"` occurred on a Friday so your output should say `"Friday".`

```{r weekdays}

```

## Knitting

To download this file and then upload to Blackboard, do the following:

1. Knit your report and verify that it looks as you want it to (that is, graphs and other output are displaying as you intended),
2. On line 5, change the `output` from "html_document" to "word_document",
3. Knit your report again to create your `preparation10.docx` file,
4. Download this document by checking the box next to this `docx` file in the **Files** pane (lower-right-hand pane), then click More > Export...
